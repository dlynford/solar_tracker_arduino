# solar_tracker_arduino
This project utilized a prefabricated kit with an Arduino R3 microprocessor, that automatically orients a solar power cell towards the sun for maximum output. The kit and its arduino code was sourced from: Brown Dog Gaddgets at https://browndoggadgets.dozuki.com/Guide/Dual+Axis+Solar+Tracker+3.0/382.

**Components:**
The version 3.0 Dual Axis Kit came with: 1/4" and 1/8" laser cut plywood infrastructure, connecting 8-32 screws and bolts, an R3 model arduino, a new digitial I/O arduino shield, a light detecting resistor board with four photocells, a small solar cell, an led voltage readout, and associated connecting wires.

**Build description:**
The projects took several hours to assemble and test. The most difficult parts of the build were modifying the through holes in the plastic servo horns to accept wood screws. Uploading the code was quite straightforward and the program was easy to run. 

**Notes:**
This project requires the use of 3 AA batteries to independantly power the servo motors. The solar cell collects around 4.5 volts to 6 volts of power only in bright direct sunlight, but the solar cell does not power any part of the kit or associated hardware. This means you can only read the output voltage the cell produces, and not use it or store it for later use in lithium rechargable batteries.  

**Tools required:**
Drill gun and drill bits (to enlarge the servo horn through hole), Philips head screwdriver/s with #2, #1, and #0 heads.
