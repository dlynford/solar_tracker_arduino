# solar_tracker_arduino
This project utilized a prefabricated kit with an Arduino R3 microprocessor, to track sunlight changes and orient a solar power cell for maximum output. The kit and its arduino code was sourced from: Brown Dog Gaddgets at https://browndoggadgets.dozuki.com.

Components included: laser cut plywood infrastructure, connecting 8-32 screws and bolts, a R3 model arduino, custom arduino shields, light resisting diodes, a small solar cell, and led voltage readout.
