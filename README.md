# solar_tracker_arduino
This project utilized a prefabricated kit with an Arduino R3 microprocessor, to track sunlight changes and orient a solar power cell for maximum output. The kit and its arduino code was sourced from: Brown Dog Gaddgets at https://browndoggadgets.dozuki.com/Guide/Dual+Axis+Solar+Tracker+3.0/382.

Components included: laser cut plywood infrastructure, connecting 8-32 screws and bolts, a R3 model arduino, a new digitial I/O arduino shield, a light detecting resistor board with four photocells, a small solar cell, and led voltage readout.
