# solar_tracker_arduino
This project utilizes an prefabbed kit with an Arduino R3, to track the changing direction of sunlight and orient a solar cell for maximum power collection.
The kit was purchased from Brown dog gaddgets https://browndoggadgets.dozuki.com, and the arduino code was supplied by them.
